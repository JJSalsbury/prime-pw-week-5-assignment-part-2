    <ul class="myListItems">
      <li>When using template literals to console.log some test outputs, I tried to log an obect name ( ex. ${me} ), and it would print the object in the following way: "Test- A little about me: [object Object]". When I tried logging the same test using single quotation marks and used the object name, it then logs correctly with the object name and all it's name/value pairs expanded. Can I even use a template literal to print an expanded object?".</li>
      <li>It's mentioned that adding the margin to the body is a good thing to add to every CSS file, and it should use the body HTML tag name. But why only this element? Why couldn't we use the class name when adjusting margins to the body?</li>
      <li>Is it possible to make within an object an array name with multiple property/values? I had trouble getting all the way through the strecth question and couldn't find a solution. I tried, just couldn't work around in time to get the assignment in.</li>
